# A-Guessing-Game-In-Python
As I have started learning Python recently so I  thought of learning python with fun &amp; have built the simple game with my basic knowledge of Python.
I have made an interactive guessing game in Python.
This is going to be a simple guessing game where the computer will generate a random number between 1 to 10, and the user has to guess it in 3 attempts.
Based on the userâ€™s guess computer will give various hints if the number is high or low. When the user guess matches the number computer willprint the answer along with the number of attempts.
